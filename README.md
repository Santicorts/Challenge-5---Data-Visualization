Challenge #5 - Data Visualization


## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze tumor volume data in mice that were treated with different drug regimens. The analysis aims to identify the effects of the treatments on tumor growth and overall health of the mice.

## Data

The data consists of two CSV files:
- `Mouse_metadata.csv`: Contains metadata about the mice, including mouse ID, drug regimen, sex, age, weight, and more.
- `Study_results.csv`: Contains the results of the study, including mouse ID, timepoint, and tumor volume.
